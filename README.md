**Search and Retrieval**: Using search algorithms to find and retrieve relevant articles based on user queries. This can involve keyword matching and other techniques to understand and interpret the query.

**Ranking and Relevance**: Sorting the retrieved articles based on their relevance to the query. This can involve factors like the frequency of keywords, the importance of the source, and the recency of the article.

**Presentation**: Displaying the search results in a user-friendly format, often with snippets or summaries of the articles to help users quickly identify the most relevant information.
